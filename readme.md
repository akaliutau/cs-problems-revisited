About 
============

This is one of my everlasting side projects. I have been solving CS puzzles to master my algorithmic skills and to reflect about perfect solution for various CS problems.
For the last 10 years I have solved in total 2000+ problems. This repository contains about 500 of them, mostly of mid-level complexity


Overview
===========

The package <b> problem </b> contains solutions of some medium-level complexity com.problems. The main accent is made on optimization and simplicity of solution. All problems are grouped by category (total 39 categories):

array <br/>
backtracking <br/>
bfs <br/>
binarysearch <br/>
bitmanipulation <br/>
bst <br/>
buckets <br/>
combinatorics <br/>
design <br/>
dfs <br/>
