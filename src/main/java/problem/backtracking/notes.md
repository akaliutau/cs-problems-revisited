Backtracking
=============

Main idea - traverse through all variants one by one, has strong relation to DFS

Best problems to apply this approach to should have the following features:

1. there must be multiple ways to solve problem, and it is necessary to find the optimal one

2. the whole space of variants can be represented by the tree of possibilities, traversed using DFS

3. every path can be segmented into steps/chunks


Algorithm:

1. make one step

2. check the condition to terminate path building:

  2.1 target has been reached
    
  2.2 constraint violation
  
3. if this point has been reached, choose in a consistent way how to lay out the next segment of path; 
   mark it as `seen` in a map or similar data structure to avoid infinite loop
   
4. make recursive call

5. clear up seen map to restore initial state 

6. (Optional) if the knowledge of actual path is required, the best structure is Stack
