/**
 * We are given some website visits: the user with name username[i] visited the
 * website website[i] at time timestamp[i].
 * 
 * A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by
 * the time of their visits. (The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily
 * distinct.)
 * 
 * Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more
 * than one solution, return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: username =
 * ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"],
 * timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 
 * website =
 * ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
 * Output: ["home","about","career"] 
 * Explanation: 
 * The tuples in this example are: 
 * ["joe", 1, "home"] 
 * ["joe", 2, "about"] 
 * ["joe", 3, "career"] 
 * ["james", 4, "home"] 
 * ["james", 5, "cart"] 
 * ["james", 6, "maps"] 
 * ["james", 7, "home"]
 * ["mary", 8, "home"] 
 * ["mary", 9, "about"] 
 * ["mary", 10, "career"] 
 * The
 * 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2 users.
 * The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
 * The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
 * The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
 * The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
 * 
 * IDEA: generate smart statistics
 * 1) generate all possible ORDERED permutations of visited sites, save freqs for each combination
 * 2) pick up the combination with the max freq
