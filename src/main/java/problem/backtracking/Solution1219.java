/**
 * In a gold mine grid of size m * n, each cell in this mine has an integer
 * representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.
 * 
 * Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
 * 
 * Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that
 * cell. 
 * 
 * From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down. 
 * 
 * You can't visit the same cell more than once. 
 * 
 * Never visit a cell with 0 gold. 
 * 
 * You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid
 * that has some gold.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: grid = 
 * [
 * [0,6,0],
 * [5,8,7],
 * [0,9,0]
 * ] Output: 24 
 * 
 * Explanation: 
 * Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * investigate all routes
 *
