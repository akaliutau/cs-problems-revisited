/**
 * 
 * You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei]
 * describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a
 * rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.
 * 
 * The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:
 * 
 * ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei. 
 * 
 * ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori. 
 * 
 * ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei. 
 * 
 * Return the number of items
 * that match the given rule.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: items =
 * [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]],
 * ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver" Output: 1 
 * 
 * Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].
