/**
 * Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and
 * return its modified list.
 * 
 * k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked
 * list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in
 * the end, should remain as it is.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * head ~ which will always point to the original head of the next set of k
 * nodes.
 * 
 * revHead ~ which is basically the tail node of the original set of k nodes.
 * Hence, this becomes the new head after reversal.
 * 
 * ktail ~ is the tail node of the previous set of k nodes after reversal.
 * 
 * newHead ~ acts as the head of the final list that we need to return as the
 * output. Basically, this is the kth node from the beginning of the original
 * list.
 * 
 * The core algorithm remains the same as before. Given the head, we first count
 * k nodes. If we are able to find at least k nodes, we reverse them and get our
 * revHead. 
 * 
 * At this point we check if we already have the variable ktail set or
 * not. It won't be set when we reverse the very first set of k nodes. However,
 * if this variable is set, then we attach ktail.next to the revHead.
 *
