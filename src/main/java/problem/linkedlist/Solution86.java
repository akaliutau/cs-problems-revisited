/**
 * Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than
 * x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
 * 
 * You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the
 * two partitions.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3 
 *       Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5 
 *  
 *  note   1 -> 2 -> 2  [<-- before 3        after 3 -->]  4 -> 3 -> 5
 *                                                       order is preserved
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * use extra 2 LL to grow both lists
