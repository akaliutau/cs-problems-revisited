/**
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem 
 * 
 * Given an array nums
 * with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that
 * objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red,
 * white, and blue. Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the
 * color red, white, and blue respectively. Follow up: Could you solve this
 * problem without using the library's sort function? Could you come up with a
 * one-pass algorithm using only O(1) constant space? 
 * 
 * Example 1: 
 * Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0] 
 * Output:       [0,0,1,1,2,2]
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * because we need to have only 3 groups of colors in the end,
 * put all found 0s to the beginning of the list
 * and all found 2s to the end
 * 
 * all 1s will be in the center automatically
 *
