/**
 * You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1
 * represents a person sitting in the ith seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that
 * the ith seat is empty (0-indexed). There is at least one empty seat, and at
 * least one person sitting. Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the
 * distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. Return that
 * maximum distance to the closest person. 
 * 
 * Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]  Output: 2 
 * 
 * Explanation: If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats[2]),
 * then the closest person has distance 2. 
 * 
 * If Alex sits in any other open seat,
 * the closest person has distance 1. Thus, the maximum distance to the closest
 * person is 2.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1) use 2 indecies which point to the left and right persons
 * 2) dynamically update these pointers (note this is not necessary happening on each cycle), calculate min distance on each empty place
 * 3) note, the position of virtual alex is updated on each cycle, but this is not true for his neighbors
