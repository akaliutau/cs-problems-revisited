Heap
=====

1. Use this structure to <em>dynamically</em> track the biggest(smallest) element on the list
2. Use data containers with custom Comparator to dynamically order these containers
3. Use this structure if there is a need to maintain a pre-sorted storage, but with knowledge of max/min elem only 
(assuming that all elems in the storage can be extracted in an ordered manner)
