/**
 * You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.
 * 
 * A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character
 * can only be used once).
 * 
 * Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach" Output: 6
 * Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer
 * is 3 + 3 = 6.
