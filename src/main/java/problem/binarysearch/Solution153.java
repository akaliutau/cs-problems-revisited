/**
 * 
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand.
 * 
 * (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 * 
 * Find the minimum element.
 * 
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [3,4,5,1,2] Output: 1
 * 
 *  IDEA: min elem = point of change
 *  
 *  
 * CASE 1
 * [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
 *        |
 *        7>0 - then this is the point of change
 * 
 * CASE 2        
 * [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
 *      |
 *      6>4  point of changes somewhere on the right piece
 *
