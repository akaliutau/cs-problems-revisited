 * 
 * There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.
 * 
 * Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard
 * (indexed from 0 to 25). Initially, your finger is at index 0. To type a
 * character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired
 * character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i -
 * j|.
 * 
 * You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time
 * it takes to type it with one finger.
