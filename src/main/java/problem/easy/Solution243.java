/**
 * 
 * Given an array of strings wordsDict and two different strings that already
 * exist in the array word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between
 * these two words in the list.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * track only the latest positions of both words, and update distance on each new word
 * 
 * why this is working:
 * 
 * case1:
 * 1a   1b  2a  <--   will be calculated distances 1a-1b and 1b-2a, others will be farer
 * 
 * case2:
 * 1a 2a 1b     <--   will be calculated distances 2a-1b only,  as 1a will be overwritten
 *
