/**
 * Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a
 * linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO
 * (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the
 * first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".
 * 
 * One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the
 * spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full,
 * we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the
 * queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new
 * values.
 * 
 * Your implementation should support following operations:
 * 
 * MyCircularQueue(k): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k. 
 * Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1. 
 * Rear:  Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
 * enQueue(value): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful. 
 * deQueue(): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful. 
 * isEmpty(): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not. 
 * isFull(): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
 * 
 *
