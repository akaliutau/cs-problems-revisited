/**
 * Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board
 * between two players:
 * 
 * A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block. Once a
 * winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed. A player who
 * succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
 * row wins the game. Implement the TicTacToe class:
 * 
 * TicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object the size of the board n. int move(int
 * row, int col, int player) Indicates that player with id player plays at the
 * cell (row, col) of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * each player either increase by 1 the cell or descrease it
 * if some  row | column | diagonal  reach sum with norm == ||n|| => someone won
 *
