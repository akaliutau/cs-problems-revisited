/**
 * [41, 35, 62, 5, 97, 108] 
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1) note that in order to calculate median only centroid or central element are needed
 * 
 * 
 * Adding  41 MaxHeap lower: [41]         MinHeap higher: []            Median is 41 
 * 
 * Adding  35 MaxHeap lower: [35]         MinHeap higher: [41]          Median is 38
 * Adding  62 MaxHeap lower: [41, 35]     MinHeap higher: [62]          Median is 41 
 * Adding  4  MaxHeap lower: [35, 4]      MinHeap higher: [41, 62]      Median is 38 
 * Adding  97 MaxHeap lower: [41, 35, 4]  MinHeap higher: [62, 97]      Median is 41 
 * Adding 108 MaxHeap lower: [41, 35, 4]  MinHeap higher: [62, 97, 108] Median is 51.5
 * 
 * elem -> transfer through 2 heaps, 
 * lower - accumulates smaller elems
 * higher - accumulates bigger elems
 * 
 * 
 *         lower                       higher
 * (..., lower.peek()), median, (higher.peek(), ...)
