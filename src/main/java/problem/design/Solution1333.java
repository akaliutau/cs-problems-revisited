/**
 * 
 * Given the array restaurants where restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei]. 
 * You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.
 * 
 * The veganFriendly filter will be either true (meaning you should only include
 * restaurants with veganFriendlyi set to true) or false (meaning you can
 * include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters maxPrice and
 * maxDistance which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants
 * you should consider respectively.
 * 
 * Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from
 * highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id
 * from highest to lowest. For simplicity veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly take
 * value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: restaurants =
 * [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]],
 * veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10 Output: [3,1,5]
 * Explanation: The restaurants are: 
 * 
 * Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10] 
 * 
 * Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5] 
 * 
 * Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4] 
 * 
 * Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3] 
 * 
 * Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1,  veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] 
 * 
 * After filter restaurants with
 * veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 
 * we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest).
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1. add a list of different implementations of Filter interface
 *
