/**
 * 
 * Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a string array board, return true if and only if
 * it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid
 * tic-tac-toe game.
 * 
 * The board is a 3 x 3 array that consists of characters ' ', 'X', and 'O'. The
 * ' ' character represents an empty square.
 * 
 * Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
 * 
 * Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '. The first
 * player always places 'X' characters, while the second player always places
 * 'O' characters. 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares,
 * never filled ones. The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty)
 * character filling any row, column, or diagonal. The game also ends if all
 * squares are non-empty. No more moves can be played if the game is over.
 * 
 * IDEA: check 4 conditions: 1) numberOfX >= numberOfO && numberOfX - numberOfO
 * <= 1 2) no 2 sums == 3 for rows of X or O
 * 
 * ["XXX",
 *  "XOO",
 *  "OO "]
