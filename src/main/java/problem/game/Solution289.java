/**
 * According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as
 * Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
 * Horton Conway in 1970." Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an
 * initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight
 * neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules
 * (taken from the above Wikipedia article): 
 * 
 * 1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population. 
 * 2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. 
 * 3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.. 
 * 4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * 
 * IDEA: 
 * 
 * use intermediate values for calculations of newborn or dead cells
 * 
 * use newVal=2 and newVal=-1 for transitions 0->1 and 1->0 appropriately
