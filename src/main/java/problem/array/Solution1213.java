/**
 * 
 * Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing
 * order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three
 * arrays.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8] Output:
 * [1,5]
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1. find and advance the smallest index first (at any time)
 * 2. equalize one by one
 * [1,2,3,4,5]
 * [1,2,5,7,9]
 * [1,3,4,5,8]
 *
 * it#0: 1
 * it#2: 2 < 3 - even if 2 first elems are equal, the 3rd breaks this and we need to advance the wnd index
 *
