/**
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
 * consecutive elements sequence. Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
 * 
 * Example: Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] Output: 4 Explanation: The longest
 * consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4
 * 
 * IDEA: find the beginning of some sequence
 * as a result the total time complexity will be O(n) - if contains operation is O(1)
 * 
 * f.e. [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] has 2 partial sequences: [100, 200] & [1,2,3,4]
 * 1) find a head
 * 2) iterate till tail
 * 3) update global max for length
