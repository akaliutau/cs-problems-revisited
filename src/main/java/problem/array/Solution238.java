/**
 * 
 * Array
 * 
 * Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, return an array output such
 * that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except
 * nums[i].
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,4] Output: [24,12,8,6]
 * 
 * 
 * IDEA: prefix product technique, in this case - running product
 * 
 * Instead of dividing the product of all the numbers in the array by the number
 * at a given index to get the corresponding product, we can make use of the
 * product of all the numbers to the left and all the numbers to the right of
 * the index. Multiplying these two individual products would give us the
 * desired result as well
