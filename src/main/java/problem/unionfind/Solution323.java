/**
 * 
 * Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each
 * edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected
 * distinctSets in an undirected graph.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
 * 
 *    0         3 
 *    |         | 
 *    1 --- 2   4
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 *  building subsets:
 *  
 *  (0,1) : 0 <- 0, 1 <- 1           => 0 <- 1, set rank(0) = 1
 *  (1,2):  0 <- 1 <- 1,  2 <- 2     => 0 <- 1 and 0 <- 2
 *  
 *  in the beginning we have distinctSets consisting from n parts, 
 *  each merge will decrease this number by 1
 *  
 *
