/**
 * There are N cities numbered from 1 to N. You are given connections, where
 * each connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost] represents the cost to connect
 * city1 and city2 together. (A connection is bidirectional: connecting city1
 * and city2 is the same as connecting city2 and city1.) 
 * 
 * Return the minimum cost
 * so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections
 * (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together. The cost is
 * the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Input: N = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]] Output: 6 Explanation:
 * Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * Use Kruskal algorithm with Find-Union approach
 * Basically this will be a spanning tree
