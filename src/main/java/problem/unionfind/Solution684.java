/**
 * In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no
 * cycles.
 * 
 * You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to
 * n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices
 * chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is
 * represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates
 * that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
 * 
 * Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n
 * nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in
 * the input.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * add nodes one by one 
 * 
 *  1 -- 2
 *  |    |
 *  3 -- 4 -- 5
 *  
 *  linking nodes:
 *  
 *  1 --> 2    <-- union returns true, as nodes are separate
 *  3 --> 4    <-- union returns true
 *  1 --> 3    <-- union returns true, as already build components 1-2 and 3-4 are separate 
 *  4 --> 5    <-- union returns true, as main cluster and node #5 are separate 
 *  2 --> 4    <-- union returns false, as nodes 2 and 4 are from the same set
 *  
 *  Note, the order of testing of nodes is not important here
 *
