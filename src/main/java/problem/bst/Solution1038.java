/**
 * Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree
 * such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus
 * sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.
 * 
 * As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these
 * constraints:
 * 
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's
 * key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than
 * the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search
 * trees.
