/**
 * You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, prevEndDayi,
 * valuei]. The ith event starts at startDayi and prevEnds at prevEndDayi, and if you
 * attend this event, you will receive a value of valuei. You are also given an
 * integer k which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.
 * 
 * You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event,
 * you must attend the entire event. Note that the prevEnd day is inclusive: that
 * is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other prevEnds
 * on the same day.
 * 
 * Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.
 * 
 * Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2 Output: 7 Explanation:
 * Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-posed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.
 * 
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * optimized BF + DFS + memoization
 * 
 * 1. try to form ALL possible seqLengths taking into account all constraints laid
 * 
 * Here is a detail example:
 * 
 *   initial: [4,3,1,2]
 *   
 *     4      3
 *   -----   -----
 *         1       2
 *      -------  ----
 *      
 *  possible sequences:
 *  [4,3]
 *  [4,2]
 *  [1,2]
 *  
 *  1a. Thoughts about constructing a key:
 *  which combination of input parameters define the state?
 *  it's seqLength and prevEnd
 *  if we have a sequence of length = l ending at prevEnd, the tail will be the same as already calculated
 *      
 *  2. use greedy approach - always take the immediate NEXT seqLength, because
 *  
 *     when we consider 
 *     0 -> 1, val = 14 
 *     1 -> 2(None), val = 13 
 *     0 -> 1, val = 14 
 *     
 *         #0       #1        #2
 *     [[1,2,1],[3,7,13],[5,6,14]]
 *     
 *     -
 *     2
 *     1
 *     0->2
 *     0->1
 *     
 *
