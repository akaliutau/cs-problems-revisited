/**
 * Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's
 * (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You
 * may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water. Find the
 * maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the
 * maximum area is 0.) 
 * 
 * Example 1: 
 * [
 * [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 * [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0], 
 * [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 * [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0], 
 * [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 * [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0], 
 * [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 * [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
 * ]
 * output: 6
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1. use dfs to traverse all cells
 * 2. track maximum among all results
