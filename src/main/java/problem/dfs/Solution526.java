/**
 * Suppose you have n integers from 1 to n. We define a beautiful arrangement as
 * an array that is constructed by these n numbers successfully if one of the
 * following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= n) in this array:
 * 
 * The number at the ith position is divisible by i. 
 * i is divisible by the number at the ith position. 
 * 
 * 
 * Given an integer n, return the number of the
 * beautiful arrangements that you can construct.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2 Output: 2 
 * 
 * Explanation: 
 * 
 * The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]: 
 * Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).
 * Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2). 
 * 
 * The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]: 
 * Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1). 
 * Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and
 * i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * investigate all possible configurations
