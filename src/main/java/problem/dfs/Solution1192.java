/**
 * There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected
 * server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b]
 * represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any
 * other server directly or indirectly through the network.
 * 
 * A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server
 * unable to reach some other server.
 * 
 * Return all critical connections in the network in any order
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * Have to mark all connections which are included into loop
 * 
 * critical conn = node which has 2 connections (at least)
 * The time at node can be relaxed if and only if there is some alternative connection 
 * WITH ALREADY SEEN NODES (== in the past)
 * 
 *     A  <--- t = 0
 *    / \ 
 *   C - B   <--- t = 1   
 *   |     <--- t = 2
 *   D
 * 
 * 1) relaxation decrease min visitTime to the lowest visitTime on the loop (if any)
 *  f.e. A->B->C->A
 *       1  2  3  1
 *       1  1  1  1
 *       C->D
 *       1  4
 *       
 *       A, B, C - form a cycle
 *       D - a separate node
