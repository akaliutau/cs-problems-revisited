/**
 * There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are
 * not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct
 * friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of
 * C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or
 * indirect friends. Given a N*N matrix adj representing the friend relationship
 * between students in the class. If adj[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students
 * are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the
 * total number of friend circles among all the students. 
 * 
 * Example 1: Input:
 * [
 * [1,1,0], 
 * [1,1,0], 
 * [0,0,1]] Output: 2 
 * 
 * Explanation:The 0th and 1st students
 * are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. The 2nd student himself
 * is in a friend circle. So return 2.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1. All circles of friends are the same as interconnected islands - use DFS to count them
 * 2. use transitive feature of dfs to detect and fill out the friend circle - the same as in islands problem
 * because all connections will be marked as visited and removed from dfs
