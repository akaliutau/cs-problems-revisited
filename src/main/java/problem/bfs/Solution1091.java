/**
 * 
 * In an N by N square grid, each cell is either empty (0) or blocked (1).
 * 
 * A clear path from top-left to bottom-right has length k if and only if it is
 * composed of cells C_1, C_2, ..., C_k such that:
 * 
 * Adjacent cells C_i and C_{i+1} are connected 8-directionally (ie., they are different and share an edge or corner) 
 * C_1 is at location (0, 0) (ie. has value grid[0][0]) 
 * C_k is at location (N-1, N-1) (ie. has value grid[N-1][N-1]) 
 * 
 * If C_i is located at (r, c), then grid[r][c] is empty (ie. grid[r][c] == 0). 
 * 
 * Return the length of the shortest such clear path from top-left to bottom-right. 
 * 
 * If such a path does not exist, return -1.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1) use a classical BFS - which is ALWAYS return the shortest path due to its nature
