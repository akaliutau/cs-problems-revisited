/**
 * You are starving and you want to eat food as quickly as possible. You want to
 * find the shortest path to arrive at any food cell.
 * 
 * You are given an m x n character matrix, grid, of these different types of
 * cells:
 * 
 * '*' is your location. There is exactly one '*' cell.
 * 
 * '#' is a food cell. There may be multiple food cells.
 * 
 * 'O' is free space, and you can travel through these cells.
 * 
 * 'X' is an obstacle, and you cannot travel through these cells.
 * 
 * You can travel to any adjacent cell north, east, south, or west of your
 * current location if there is not an obstacle.
 * 
 * Return the length of the shortest path for you to reach any food cell. If
 * there is no path for you to reach food, return -1.
 * 
 * IDEA: 
 * use pure BFS, layer by layer propagation
 * 
 * ["X","X","X","X","X"]
 * ["X","*","X","O","X"]
 * ["X","O","X","#","X"]
 * ["X","X","X","X","X"]
