/**
 * 
 * On an 8x8 chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.
 * 
 * Given an array of integer coordinates queens that represents the positions of
 * the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates king that represent the position
 * of the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order)
 * that can attack the King.
 * 
 * Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0] Output:
 * [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * The queen at [0,1] can attack the king cause they're in the same row.
 * 
 * The queen at [1,0] can attack the king cause they're in the same column.
 * 
 * The queen at [3,3] can attack the king cause they're in the same diagnal.
 * 
 * The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at
 * [0,1].
 * 
 * The queen at [4,0] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at
 * [1,0].
 * 
 * The queen at [2,4] can't attack the king cause it's not in the same
 * row/column/diagonal as the king.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * start layered BFS with seed point at king, 
 * and try to spot the queens using direct rays starting from king
 *
