/**
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and
 * 1 represents a land cell.
 * 
 * A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent
 * (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid.
 * 
 * Return the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the
 * boundary of the grid in any number of moves.
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]] Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that is
 * not enclosed because its on the boundary.
 * 
 * [
 * [0,1,1,0],
 * [0,0,1,0],
 * [0,0,1,0],
 * [0,0,0,0]
 * ]
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * BFS from edge cells
 * 
 * after that count all cells which are 1s
