/**
 * Given a matrix of integers grid with R rows and C columns, find the maximum
 * score of a path starting at [0,0] and ending at [R-1,C-1].
 * 
 * The score of a path is the minimum value in that path. For example, the value
 * of the path 8 → 4 → 5 → 9 is 4.
 * 
 * grid path moves some number of times from one visited cell to any neighbouring
 * unvisited cell in one of the 4 cardinal directions (north, east, west,
 * south).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * [ 
 * [5,4,5], 
 * [1,2,6], 
 * [7,4,6]
 * ]
 * 
 * Output: 4 (5 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 6)
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1) the score of the whole path is determined by the min value in the chain 
 *    => the winning strategy will be to avoid min as long until it's possible
 *    
 *    Use  PriorityQueue to pick up next the cell with the max score FIRST, among all neighbors
 *    
 *    As a result all cells in queue will be prioritized with the max score on the top => optimal 
 *    [not necessary the shortest] path
