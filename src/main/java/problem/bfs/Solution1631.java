/**
 * You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given efforts, a 2D
 * array of size rows x columns, where efforts[row][col] represents the effort
 * of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you
 * hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e.,
 * 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a
 * route that requires the minimum effort. A route's effort is the maximum
 * absolute difference in efforts between two consecutive cells of the route.
 * Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the
 * bottom-right cell. 
 * 
 * Input: efforts = 
 * [
 * [1,2,2],
 * [3,8,2],
 * [5,3,5]
 * ] 
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2
 * in consecutive cells. This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the
 * maximum absolute difference is 3.
 * 
 * IDEA (similar to 1102):
 * 
 *  As a result all cells in queue will be prioritized by min effort on the top => optimal 
 *    [not necessary the shortest] path 
 *    
 * explicit greedy approach - we are trying the effortless paths first
