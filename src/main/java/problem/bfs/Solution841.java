/**
 * 
 * There are N rooms and you start in room 0. Each room has a distinct number in
 * 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, and each room may have some keys to access the next room.
 * 
 * Formally, each room i has a list of keys rooms[i], and each key rooms[i][j]
 * is an integer in [0, 1, ..., N-1] where N = rooms.length. A key rooms[i][j] =
 * v opens the room with number v.
 * 
 * Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room 0).
 * 
 * You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.
 * 
 * Return true if and only if you can enter every room.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [[1],[2],[3],[]] Output: true 
 * 
 * Explanation: We start in room 0, and
 * pick up key 1. We then go to room 1, and pick up key 2. We then go to room 2,
 * and pick up key 3. We then go to room 3. Since we were able to go to every
 * room, we return true.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1. start from initial room
 * 2. get the keys, go to all rooms we currently have keys, repeat
 *
