/**
 * Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common
 * subsequence. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the
 * original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing
 * the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence
 * of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a
 * subsequence that is common to both strings. If there is no common
 * subsequence, return 0.
