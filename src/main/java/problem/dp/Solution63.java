 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in
 * the diagram below). The robot can only move either down or right at any point
 * in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid
 * (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below). Now consider if some obstacles are
 * added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
