/**
 * 
 * Given an integer n, your task is to count how many strings of length n can be
 * formed under the following rules:
 * 
 * Each character is a lower case vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') Each vowel 'a'
 * may only be followed by an 'e'. Each vowel 'e' may only be followed by an 'a'
 * or an 'i'. Each vowel 'i' may not be followed by another 'i'. Each vowel 'o'
 * may only be followed by an 'i' or a 'u'. Each vowel 'u' may only be followed
 * by an 'a'. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 1 Output: 5 
 * 
 * Explanation: All possible strings are: "a", "e", "i" , "o" and "u".
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1. de-facto the same as factorial calculations
 * 2. start from the base case, namely from strings of length=1, and try to increase length, 
 *     using pre-calculated amount of strings at the previous steps
 *
