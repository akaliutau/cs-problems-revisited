/**
 * Given a positive integer n, return the number of all possible attendance
 * records with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable. The answer may
 * be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7. A student attendance record is a
 * string that only contains the following three characters: 
 * 'A' : Absent. 
 * 'L' : Late. 
 * 'P' : Present. 
 * 
 * A record is regarded as rewardable if it doesn't contain
 * more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late). 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 2 Output: 8 Explanation: There are 8 records with length 2 will be
 * regarded as rewardable: "PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL" Only
 * "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent times.
 * 
 * IDEA:
