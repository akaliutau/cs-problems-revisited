/**
 * A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that
 * have the same frequency.
 * 
 * Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete
 * to make s good.
 * 
 * The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in
 * the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2,
 * while the frequency of 'b' is 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "aab" Output: 0 Explanation: s is already good. Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "aaabbbcc" Output: 2 Explanation: You can delete two 'b's
 * resulting in the good string "aaabcc". Another way it to delete one 'b' and
 * one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * because there are more than one way to solve problem, this is a hint to use DP 
 * (in other words, investigate all possible variants using some caching techniques to decrease the 
 *  space of all possible variants)
 *  
 * For example, let start from the string aaabbbcc
 * 
 *              aaabbbcc
 *             /      \
 *         aaabbcc     aaabbbc
 *        /             \
 *      aaabcc          aaabbc
 *      
 *  Reformulated problem:
 *   what is the min # of update operations to make this map containing only unique values    
 *      id1 => 3
 *      id2 => 3
 *      id3 => 2
 *      
 *      OO        O#
 *      OOO   --> OO# 
 *      OOO       OOO
 *      
 *   case with big deficit of values:
 *         
 *      OO        O#
 *      OO   -->  OO 
 *      OOO       OOO
 *
