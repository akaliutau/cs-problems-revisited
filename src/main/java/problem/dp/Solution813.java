/**
 * We partition a row of numbers a into at most k adjacent (non-empty) groups,
 * then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest
 * score we can achieve? note that our partition must use every number in a, and
 * that scores are not necessarily integers. 
 * 
 * Example: Input: a = [9,1,2,3,9] k = 3 Output: 20 
 * 
 * Explanation: The best choice is to partition a into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. 
 * The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20. We could have also
 * partitioned a into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example. That partition would
 * lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse
