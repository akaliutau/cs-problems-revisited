/**
 * There are n different online courses numbered from 1 to n. You are given an
 * array courses where courses[i] = [durationi, lastDayi] indicate that the ith
 * course should be taken continuously for durationi days and must be finished
 * before or on lastDayi.
 * 
 * You will start on the 1st day and you cannot take two or more courses
 * simultaneously.
 * 
 * Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: courses = [[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]] Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
 * First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the
 * 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day. Second, take
 * the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day,
 * and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. Third, take the 2nd
 * course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. The 4th
 * course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which
 * exceeds the closed date.
