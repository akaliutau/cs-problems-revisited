/**
 * 
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
 * on day i.
 * 
 * If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one
 * and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum
 * profit.
 * 
 * Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell
 * on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs
 * to be larger than buying price.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * max profit at any time = cur_price  - min price seen so far
 *
