/**
 * 
 * Given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should
 * perform a cut at.
 * 
 * You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as
 * you wish.
 * 
 * The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is
 * the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two
 * smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick
 * before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.
 * 
 * Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * Brute Force with optimization
 * 
 * 1. use recursion with memoization to speed up the process
 * 
 * 0  2   5  7   10
 * |oo|ooo|oo|ooo|
 * 
 * 
 * Memoizing: the result of cutting of stick with left:right (NOTE the position is important)
