/**
 * On an nxn chessboard, a knight starts at the r-th row and c-th column and
 * attempts to make exactly K moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so the
 * top-left square is (0, 0), and the bottom-right square is (n-1, n-1).
 * 
 * A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each
 * move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal
 * direction.
 * 
 * Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves
 * uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves
 * there.
 * 
 * The knight continues moving until it has made exactly K moves or has moved
 * off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the
 * board after it has stopped moving.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: 3, 2, 0, 0 Output: 0.0625 
 * Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2),
 * (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board. From each of those positions,
 * there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board. The total
 * probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
