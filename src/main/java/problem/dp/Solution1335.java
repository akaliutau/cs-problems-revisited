/**
 * DP
 * 
 * You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To
 * work on the i-th job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
 * 
 * You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job
 * schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty
 * of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.
 * 
 * Given an array of integers jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of
 * the i-th job is jobDifficulty[i].
 * 
 * Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a
 * schedule for the jobs return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2 Output: 7 
 * Explanation: First day
 * you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6. Second day you can
 * finish the last job, total difficulty = 1. The difficulty of the schedule = 6
 * + 1 = 7
 * 
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * Reducing equation
 * 
 * [6,5,4,3,2,1]
 *      |
 *      
 * [6,5,4] [3,2,1] <-- cut off the last day with job array == 3  + all the rest n-1 days 
 * 
 * 
 * [6,5] [4,3,2,1]
 *   |       max = the most difficult job seen so far
 *   |       
 *   |       
 *  reduced solution
 *         
 *          
 * Time complexity of BF: O(n^d)
 * Time complexity of DP: O(n*d) - theoretical min
 * 
 * In accordance with DP-type problem analysis:
 * 
 * 1. param space: length of input + # of days
 * 2. edge case: d=1: ans = max(of input)
 * 3. state = dp(n,d) - the solution
 * 4. state relations: 
 *        dp(n,d) = min(dp(n-1-i,d-1) + jobDiff(i,1))
 *                   i
 *  
 * Simulation
 * 		[1,1,1]
 *            \
 *            min([1,1][1], [1],[1,1])
 *            /                      \
 *       min([1][1])                 min([1])
