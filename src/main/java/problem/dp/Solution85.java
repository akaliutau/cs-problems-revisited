/**
 * Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest
 * rectangle containing only 1's and return its area. 
 * Input: matrix = [
 * ["1","0","1","0","0"], 
 * ["1","0","1","1","1"], 
 * ["1","1","1","1","1"],
 * ["1","0","0","1","0"]
 * ] 
 * 
 * Output: 6 Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * Imagine an algorithm where for each point we computed a rectangle by doing the following:
 * 1) Finding the maximum height of the rectangle by iterating upwards until a 0 is reached
 * 2) Finding the maximum width of the rectangle by iterating outwards left and right
 *    until a height that doesn't accommodate the maximum height of the rectangle
 *    
 * for each row use 2 pointers:
 * left[i] - the last left edge of rectangle on the [0,i]
 * right[i] - the last right edge of rectangle on the [i,n-1]
 * height[i] - the best top edge of the bar on the [0,row]   
 * 
 * left array for row 1
 * ["0","0","2","0","0"], 
 * ["0","4","2","4","4"], 
 * h=1   0   1   0   0
 * 
 * left array for row 2
 * ["0","0","2","2","2"], 
 * ["0","4","2","4","4"],
 * h=2   0   2   1   1
 *  
 * left array for row 3
 * ["0","0","2","2","2"],
 * ["4","4","2","4","4"]
 * h=2   0   3   2   2
