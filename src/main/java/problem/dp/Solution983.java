/**
 * In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train traveling
 * one year in advance. The days of the year that you will travel is given as an
 * array days. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365. Train tickets are sold in 3
 * different ways: a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars; a 7-day pass is
 * sold for costs[1] dollars; a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars. The
 * passes allow that many days of consecutive travel. 
 * 
 * For example, if we get a
 * 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the
 * given list of days
