/**
 * Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.
 * 
 * Let's say word1 is a predecessor of word2 if and only if we can add exactly
 * one letter anywhere in word1 to make it equal to word2. For example, "abc" is
 * a predecessor of "abac".
 * 
 * A word chain is a sequence of words [word_1, word_2, ..., word_k] with k >=
 * 1, where word_1 is a predecessor of word_2, word_2 is a predecessor of
 * word_3, and so on.
 * 
 * Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the
 * given list of words.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"] Output: 4 
 * 
 * Explanation: One of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
 * 
 * IDEA:
