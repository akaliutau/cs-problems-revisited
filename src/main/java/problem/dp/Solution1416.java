/**
 * A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to
 * print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits and all we
 * know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1, k] and there are
 * no leading zeros in the array.
 * 
 * Given the string s and the integer k. There can be multiple ways to restore
 * the array.
 * 
 * Return the number of possible array that can be printed as a string s using
 * the mentioned program.
 * 
 * The number of ways could be very large so return it modulo 10^9 + 7
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "1000", k = 10000 Output: 1 Explanation: The only possible array
 * is [1000] Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "1000", k = 10 Output: 0 Explanation: There cannot be an array
 * that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10.
 * 
 * IDEA:
