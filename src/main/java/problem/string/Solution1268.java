/**
 * Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to design
 * a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each
 * character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common
 * prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a
 * common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.
 * 
 * Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of
 * searchWord is typed.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"],
 * searchWord = "mouse" 
 * Output: 
 * [ 
 * ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
 * ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"], 
 * ["mouse","mousepad"], 
 * ["mouse","mousepad"],
 * ["mouse","mousepad"] ] 
 * 
 * Explanation: products sorted lexicographically =
 * ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"] 
 * 
 * After typing m and mo all
 * products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"] 
 * 
 * After typing
 * mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
 * 
 * IDEA
 * 1) form a sorted list of all products
 * 2) on each iteration create a search word with length in [0, max_len] 
 * 3) compose a list of products to return
