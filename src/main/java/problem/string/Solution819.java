/**
 * Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word
 * that is not in the list of banned words. It is guaranteed there is at least
 * one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique.
 * 
 * Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of
 * punctuation. Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive. The answer is in
 * lowercase.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
 * banned = ["hit"] Output: "ball" Explanation: "hit" occurs 3 times, but it is
 * a banned word. "ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the
 * most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. Note that words in the
 * paragraph are not case sensitive, that punctuation is ignored (even if
 * adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), and that "hit" isn't the answer even
 * though it occurs more because it is banned.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * use statistics/collector pattern - 
 * collect all information about frequencies, then pick up the one from top 
 *
