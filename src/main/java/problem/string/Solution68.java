/**
 * Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each
 * line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
 * You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words
 * as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each
 * line has exactly maxWidth characters. Extra spaces between words should be
 * distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not
 * divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned
 * more spaces than the slots on the right. For the last line of text, it should
 * be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words. 
 * 
 * Input: words
 * = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."] maxWidth =
 * 16 
 * 
 * Output: 
 * [ 
 * "This is an", 
 * "example of text", 
 * "justification. " 
 * ]
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * try to add as many words as possible, until max size has reached, then start a new line 
 *
