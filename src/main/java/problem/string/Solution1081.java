/**
 * 
 * Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. 
 * You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "bcabc"
 * Output: "abc"
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * use freq map, iterate through array from back, removing duplicates on the way
 * 
 * aswddefghjsd
 *  | ||     ||
 *  |        |
 *           |
 *          will be added after frequency nullification
 *  
 *  
 * a        taken=[a]        a is single, will never be touched again (while loop stops)
 * as       taken=[a,s]      s has a frequency 2, will be added one time NOTE: if a had freq > 1, then astua: astu < stua
 * asw      taken=[a,s,w]    w is single, will never be touched again (while loop stops)
 * aswd     taken=[a,s,w,d]
 * aswde    taken=[a,s,w,d,e]
 *  
 * complexity O(2n)
