/**
 * 
 * There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane.
 * Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it
 * completes its moves.
 * 
 * The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i]
 * represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D
 * (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its
 * moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R" will always make
 * the robot move to the right once, "L" will always make it move left, etc.
 * Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each
 * move.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * update coords on each move
 *
