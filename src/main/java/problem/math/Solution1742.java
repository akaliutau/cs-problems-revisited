/**
 * You are working in a ball factory where you have n balls numbered from
 * lowLimit up to highLimit inclusive (i.e., n == highLimit - lowLimit + 1), and
 * an infinite number of boxes numbered from 1 to infinity.
 * 
 * Your job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal
 * to the sum of digits of the ball's number. For example, the ball number 321
 * will be put in the box number 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 and the ball number 10 will be
 * put in the box number 1 + 0 = 1.
 * 
 * Given two integers lowLimit and highLimit, return the number of balls in the
 * box with the most balls.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: lowLimit = 1, highLimit = 10 Output: 2
 * 
 * Explanation: Box Number: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...
 * 
 * Ball Count: 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 ...
 * 
 * Box 1 has the most number of balls with 2 balls.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * max number is 99999 => there are 45 boxes maximum
