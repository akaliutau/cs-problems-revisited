/**
 * A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
 * exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles
 * is a tree. Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of
 * n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected
 * edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of
 * the tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result tree
 * has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height
 * (i.e. min(h)) are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Return a list of all
 * MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order. The height of a
 * rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the
 * root and a leaf.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * The idea is that we trim out the leaf nodes layer by layer, until we reach
 * the core of the graph, which are the CENTROIDS nodes.
 * 
 * Once we trim out the first layer of the leaf nodes (nodes that have only one
 * connection), some of the non-leaf nodes would become leaf nodes.
 *
 * The trimming process continues until there are only two nodes left in the
 * graph, which are the CENTROIDS that we are looking for.
 *
