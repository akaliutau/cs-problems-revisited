/**
 * 
 * Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly
 * the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a
 * tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s
 * could also be considered as a subtree of itself.
 * 
 * 
 * 2 Nodes are equal if: 
 * 
 * 1) they both empty 
 * 
 * 2) both have the same value 
 * 
 * 3) the same is true for each underlying level
 * 
 * IDEA: 
 * consider each node in s as root node and check subtrees starting from this point on equality
 * 
 * There are 2 DFS processes:
 * 1) dfs - needed to init the 2nd dfs with root @ the same level || asymmetric
 * 2) equals (dfs by type) - actual check on tree's equality
 * 
 * complexity: in worst case O(n^2)
