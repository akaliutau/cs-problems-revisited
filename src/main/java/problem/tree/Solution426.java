/**
 * Convert a Binary Search Tree to a sorted Circular Double-Linked List in
 * place. 
 * 
 * You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the
 * predecessor and successor pointers in a double-linked list. For a circular
 * double-linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element,
 * and the successor of the last element is the first element. We want to do the
 * transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the
 * tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point
 * to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of
 * the linked list. 
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * 1) if to use INORDER traversing, the business logic will be executed one nodes as they are linked in list
 * 2) use global tuple (first, last) to form a chain segment
 *  
 * Initiate the first and the last nodes as nulls. 
 *   Call the inorder recursion dfs(root) : 
 *    If node is not null : Call the recursion for the left subtree dfs(node.left). 
 *    If the last node is not null, link the last and the current node nodes. 
 *    Else initiate the first node. 
 *    Mark the current node as the last one : last = node.
 *    Call the recursion for the right subtree dfs(node.right). 
 * Link the first and the last nodes to close DLL ring and then return the first node.
