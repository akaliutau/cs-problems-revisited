/**
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of
 * two given nodes in the BST.
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
 * is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p
 * and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 *
 * IDEA:
 *             6
 *           /   \ 
 *         2       8
 *       /  \     /  \
 *      0    4   7    9 
 *          / \
 *         3   5
 *         
 * Having left and right values, traverse the BST with them:
 *          
 * In BST parent value is always a mid point
 * 
 * case 1:
 * both values are > mid point, then investigate the right branch
 * 
 * case 2:
 * both values are < mid point, then investigate the left branch
 * 
 * case 3:
 * else the values must be in different branches => this mid point is a LCA
