/**
 * Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node
 * target in the original tree.
 * 
 * The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.
 * 
 * Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.
 * 
 * Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the target
 * node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.
 * 
 * Follow up: Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 1. strait-forward: just traverse tree using pre-order and compare for simple equality
 * 2. exit condition - when the target is met
