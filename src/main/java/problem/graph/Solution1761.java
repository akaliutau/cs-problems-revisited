/**
 * You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer n which is the
 * number of nodes in the graph and an array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui,
 * vi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between ui and vi.
 * 
 * A connected trio is a set of three nodes where there is an edge between every
 * pair of them.
 * 
 * The degree of a connected trio is the number of edges where one endpoint is
 * in the trio, and the other is not.
 * 
 * Return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the
 * graph has no connected trios.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * use adjacency matrix as we only have to know that nodes u  and v connected or not
 * 
 * 1. build adjacency matrix (connected) first:
 * 
 *    | 0 1 2 3 4 
 * ___|____________
 * 0  | 1
 * 1  |   1 1   1
 * 2  |   1 1 0 1 
 * 3  |       1
 * 4  |   1 1   1
 *  
 *  
 * 2. iterate through all edges and for  each already connected u & v find a such w, that w <-> u & w <-> v.
 * 3. calculate degree taking into account that in triangle base degree == 6 
 *
