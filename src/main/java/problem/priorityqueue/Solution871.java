/**
 * A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles
 * east of the starting position.
 * 
 * Along the way, there are gas stations. Each station[i] represents a gas
 * station that is station[i][0] miles east of the starting position, and has
 * station[i][1] liters of gas.
 * 
 * The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel
 * liters of fuel in it. It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.
 * 
 * When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all
 * the gas from the station into the car.
 * 
 * What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to
 * reach its destination? If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.
 * 
 * Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can
 * still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it
 * is still considered to have arrived.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * When we run out of fuel before reaching the next station, we'll retroactively fuel up: 
 * greedily choosing the largest gas stations first.
 *
 * This is guaranteed to succeed because we drive the largest distance possible before each refueling stop, 
 * and therefore have the largest choice of gas stations to (retroactively) stop at.
 * 
 * at each station decide what might be done on the previous one: to take it OR continue to drive on the left gas
 * 
 * make choice: take or continue			
 * |           |         |
 * add 5       add 4    add2
