/**
 * You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings,
 * some bricks, and some ladders. You start your journey from building 0 and
 * move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders. While moving
 * from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed), If the current building's height
 * is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a
 * ladder or bricks. If the current building's height is less than the next
 * building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
 * Return the farthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the
 * given ladders and bricks optimally.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * Reserve in (Priority)Queue a list of blocks to be covered by ladders and then dynamically optimize it
 * Use a heap to update list using the most optimal (==smallest gap) to covered by bricks
