Priority Queue aka Heap
=========================

1. Use this structure to <em>dynamically</em> track the biggest(smallest) element on the list

2. Use data containers with custom Comparator to dynamically order these containers

3. PQ can be used if there is no need to have the whole array sorted, but only to track the highest (lowest) element - problem 295
