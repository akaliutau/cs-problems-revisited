/**
 * We have a list of points on the plane. Find the K closest points to the
 * origin (0, 0).
 * 
 * (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)
 * 
 * You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique
 * (except for the order that it is in.)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1 Output: [[-2,2]] Explanation: The
 * distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10). The distance between (-2,
 * 2) and the origin is sqrt(8). Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to
 * the origin. We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the
 * answer is just [[-2,2]]
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * option1. use a data structure with ordering by distance to the point (0,0)
 * option2. use partitioning
