/**
 * 
 * We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.
 * 
 * For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign
 * represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left).
 * Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
 * 
 * Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids
 * meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will
 * explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5] Output: [5,10] Explanation: The 10 and -5
 * collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
 * 
 * asteroids = [5, 10, -5] Output: [5, 10]
 * 
 * asteroids = [-5, 10, -5] Output: [-5, 10]
 * 
 * IDEA:
 *  Use stack to collect asteroids flying in one direction, and 
 *  update this stack each time the opposite direction is met
 *  
 *  1) consider only one direction
 *  2) for each negative asteroid:
 *       check it's survival 
 *       
 *  the final state of Stack will show all survived asteroids
