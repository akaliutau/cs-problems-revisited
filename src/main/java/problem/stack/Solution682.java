/**
 * You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game
 * consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future
 * rounds' scores.
 * 
 * At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a
 * list of strings ops, where ops[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the
 * record and is one of the following:
 * 
 * An integer x - Record a new score of x. 
 * 
 * "+" - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two
 * previous scores. 
 * 
 * "D" - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score. 
 * 
 * "C" - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. It is guaranteed there will
 * always be a previous score. 
 * 
 * Return the sum of all the scores on the record.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"] Output: 30 
 * Explanation: "5" - Add 5 to the
 * record, record is now [5]. "2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
 * "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5]. "D" - Add
 * 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10]. "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the
 * record, record is now [5, 10, 15]. The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.
 * 
 * IDEA: 
 * use stack to build up history of operations and state
