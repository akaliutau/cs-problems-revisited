/**
 * On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N
 * <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid. Our goal is to
 * assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we
 * choose the (worker, bike) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between
 * each other, and assign the bike to that worker. 
 * 
 * (If there are multiple
 * (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the
 * pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that,
 * we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). 
 * 
 * We repeat this process
 * until there are no available workers. The Manhattan distance between two
 * points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|. 
 * 
 * Return
 * a vector ans of length N, where ans[i] is the index (0-indexed) of the bike
 * that the i-th worker is assigned to 
 * 
 * Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes =
 * [[1,2],[3,3]] Output: [1,0] 
 * 
 * explanation: Worker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are
 * closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned to the Bike 1. So the output is [1, 0].
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * use data structure to dynamically track the closest Bike to the Worker
 * 1) generate all possible pairs
 * 2) the satisfactory candidate is always on the top 
 *
