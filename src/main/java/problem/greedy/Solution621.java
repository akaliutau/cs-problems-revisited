/**
 * Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do,
 * where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any
 * order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU
 * could complete either one task or just be idle.
 * 
 * However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown
 * period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that
 * there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.
 * 
 * Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish
 * all the given tasks
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * The total number of CPU intervals we need consists of busy and idle slots.
 * Number of busy slots is defined by the number of tasks to execute:
 * len(tasks). The problem is to compute a number of idle slots.
 * 
 * Maximum possible number of idle slots is defined by the frequency of the most
 * frequent task: idle_time <= (f_max - 1) * n.
 * 
 * Example:
 * ABCA, cooling=2
 * 
 * |AAAA|B   |C   |
 * cooling
 * 
 * just calculate #empty + tot_len  of letters
 *
