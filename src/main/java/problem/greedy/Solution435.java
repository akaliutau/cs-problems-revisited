/**
 * Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you
 * need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. Example 1:
 * Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]] Output: 1 Explanation: [1,3] can be removed
 * and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 *  consider continuous removal: 
 *  1) collect the statistics about overlaps for each interval
 *  2) sort them
 *  [1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3] =>
 *  
 *  [1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[3,4]
 *  
 *  
 *  O(n^2) for stat
 *  O(n^2) for iterative removal
