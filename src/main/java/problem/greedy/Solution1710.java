/**
 * You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a
 * 2D array boxTypes, where boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]:
 * 
 * numberOfBoxesi is the number of boxes of type i. 
 * numberOfUnitsPerBoxi is the number of units in each box of the type i. 
 * 
 * You are also given an integer
 * truckSize, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck.
 * You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes
 * does not exceed truckSize.
 * 
 * Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4 Output: 8 
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * There are: 
 * - 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units. 
 * - 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each. 
 * - 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each. 
 * 
 * You can take all the boxes of the first and second
 * types, and one box of the third type. The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8. 
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * use greedy approach - use all biggest units first, then smaller, and so on
