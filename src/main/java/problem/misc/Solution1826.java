/**
 * An experiment is being conducted in a lab. To ensure accuracy, there are two
 * sensors collecting data simultaneously. You are given two arrays sensor1 and
 * sensor2, where sensor1[i] and sensor2[i] are the ith data points collected by
 * the two sensors.
 * 
 * However, this type of sensor has a chance of being defective, which causes
 * exactly one data point to be dropped. After the data is dropped, all the data
 * points to the right of the dropped data are shifted one place to the left,
 * and the last data point is replaced with some random value. It is guaranteed
 * that this random value will not be equal to the dropped value.
 * 
 * For example, if the correct data is [1,2,3,4,5] and 3 is dropped, the sensor
 * could return [1,2,4,5,7] (the last position can be any value, not just 7). We
 * know that there is a defect in at most one of the sensors. Return the sensor
 * number (1 or 2) with the defect. If there is no defect in either sensor or if
 * it is impossible to determine the defective sensor, return -1.
 * 
 * IDEA:
 * 
 * 1. consider one sensor to be faulty, and the other not, calculate the number of drops and positions
 *
